Hey Matt,

Support got back to me and basically said that the account holder has to open a case, or grant me permission to open a support case. 

To open a case:

1. Login using the orange "Sign In to the Console" button in the upper-right at aws.amazon.com
2. Enter "support" in the "Find Services" search bar
3. Click the orange "Create case" button
4. Click the white "Account and billing support" button
5. Pick a type and category (doesn't really matter) and then fill out the subject and description

To give me support permission:

1. Login and search for "IAM" in the search bar
2. Click the "Users" link in the left-hand navigation bar
3. Click directly on my IAM name "matthiggin" (and not the checkbox)
4. Click the blue "Add Permissions" button
5. Click the white "Attach existing policies directly" button
6. Search for "support" in the search bar
7. Click the checkboxes next to "AWSSupportAccess" and "SupportUser"
8. Click the blue "Next: Review" button in the bottom right corner
9. Click the blue "Add permissions" button in the bottom right corner
